# SQL-Append-and-Rename
A very simple function to rename and append content to .SQL files, which helps in my actual job.

Simple code developed to help with a task at my job, where I needed to add SQL scripts to several files to update multiple versions of the product.

The code renames the files for versioning and appends the content of a specified .txt file (which contains the new SQL script) to all other files in the folder.
